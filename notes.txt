# Common Terminologies
Directory => Folder
Terminal or Command Line => Interface for Text Commands
CLI => Command Line Interface
cd => Change Directory
Repository => Project, Codebase Folder
GitHub => Website to host Repositories online
Git => tool and system for version control



# Git Commands:
clone => duplicate a remote repository to local machine
add => track your files and changes in Git
commit => save your files/changes in Git
push => upload Git commits to a remote repo, like GitHub, GitLab, GitBucket
pull => download changes from remote repo to local machine



# Command Prompt
see all files in dir => dir 
Show all files => dir /a
# PowerShell
see all files in dir => Get-ChildItem 
Show all files => Get-ChildItem -Force
shells => Command Prompt(old), PowerShell(2006-new), Git Bash, WSL
Terminal => Not a shell itself — it’s an app to host multiple shells
// All commands of command Prompt should work with PowerShell
// VS Code naturally supports PowerShell until opening command Prompt saperately 




git clone <SSH key> => git init + download files from remote origin + set remote origin to SSH url 
git init => initialize a local repo
git add . => Stage all files weather untracked(git never saw file) or modified(we change a file that git has)
git commit -m "Initial commit" => Commit locally
git branch -M main => select main as branch, this happens locally
git remote add origin <url> => Link to a remote repo by specifying an origin
git push -u origin main => Push to remote origin -u sets --set-upstream so Git knows where to push and pull by default



# stagging a file
git status => branch, ahead/behind remote, U-untracked files, M-files not staged but modified, Changes staged for commit 
git add ./<filename> => stage a single untracked file
git rm --cached <filename> => to unstage back the untracked files, also unstages modified files back



# to restore to latest commit
git restore --staged notes.txt => restore from stages no change in file but the staged data is removed
git restore notes.txt => file gets changed to previous commit



# to restore to a very old commmit
git log -- notes.txt => find a commit hash for a specific version
git restore --source <commit-hash> -- notes.txt => restore the specific file from a specific commit
git restore --source <commit-hash> -- . => restore codebase to a specific commit



# branches in git
git branch => see branches locally
git branch -a => see remote branches
# make a new branch a upstream and stop tracking old branch
git branch --unset-upstream
git checkout -b <new-branch>
git push -u origin <new-branch> || git switch -c <new-branch>



# Remote origins in git
git remote -v => show origin names
git remote show origin => shows origin with more details
git remote remove origin => remove an origin after adding it
git fetch origin => if remote has some changes then fetch it before pushing
git push origin main => push code to origin and its main branch
git push, git pull => if use -u in "git push -u origin main" -u sets --set-upstream so Git knows where to push and pull by default



# Add the remote with the fetch URL
git remote add origin https://github.com/aniket-2003-das/Git-and-GitHub.git
# Set fetch URL for fetch only if required
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/aniket-2003-das/Git-and-GitHub.git
# Set push URL separately
git remote set-url --push origin git@github.com:aniket-2003-das/Git-and-GitHub.git
