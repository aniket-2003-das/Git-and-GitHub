git branch => see branches locally
git branch -a => see remote branches
# stop tracking old branch
git branch --unset-upstream



# make a new branch 
git checkout -b <new-branch>
(git checkout main => go to main branch)
(git diff newbranch => type command in main branch to see changes)
(git merge new branch => type command in main branch to merge changes new branch)
// Dont push create a pull request




# push changes of new branch
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit in new branch"

// suppose at any time after making a pull request from new branch the new branch is merged by senior i want access to new codebase of main
(git checkout main => go to main branch)
git pull origin main
// delete new branch
git branch -d new-branch-name 
// update new branch with main
git merge main => can/will have version conflicts to resolve manually
